## Welcome!

### Game Jam Project

Embedded below is a short playthrough of my group's submission for a class Hackathon. I worked with 4 other people to complete this game in roughly 72 hours, and received first place by a panel of judges. Additionally, we had to fit our game into the theme of being "stuck in a loop," so we decided on a 2D infinite side-scroller where the player runs away from demons and dodges obstacles for as long as possible.

### Stygian Demo

Embedded below is a demo of my game/level "Stygian", which was developed for my high school capstone. It was created in Unreal Engine 4 (coded mainly via Blueprint), and modeled/animated in 3D using Blender. Additionally, in-game texturing was completed within UE4.

### Building Escape UE4 Project

This game is the product of a Udemy course I took in the past, named "Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games". Within this game, you are tasked with figuring out how to escape a locked room. There are also multiple objects that can be carried and dropped by using the left mouse button. Essentially, one can escape the room by moving items into the blue spotlight (as shown in video below) such that their combined mass triggers the doors to open. (Code and other assets are located in the "Building-Escape-Project" branch at the GitHub link above.)

### Battle Tank UE4 Project (unfinished)

Here is another project that I worked on through the Udemy course mentioned above. However, the project that was previously in the course is now in one entitled "Unreal Engine C++ Developer Archived Course", as the creators recently revamped their content. Although I have not finished this game, the point of it is to battle against AI tanks in an open-world landscape. (Code and other assets are located in the "Battle-Tank-Project" branch at the GitHub link above.)

### Blender Projects

Here are some other objects that I modeled and textured in 3D using Blender:
